# User-Intelligence
Ideated, created with SQL and DBT, and deployed (version control, CI/CD) User Intelligence dataplatform, centralizing key user informations, also engineering features. What makes a user more likely to be retained?


# User Intelligence Data Platform

## Overview
The Worker Intelligence Data Platform is a comprehensive solution that aims to enhance company user knowledge by centralizing and creating useful user features. This project involves ideation, building using SQL and DBT, and deploying using CI/CD to create a powerful productionalised data platform. I idetated, built it and deployed it during my time at Indeed. I learnt on the go Data Engineering skills, as I come from a Data Science Background. I felt I needed to quickly access and leverage key user information, and the infrastructure was not there, so I built it.

The key objectives of the Worker Intelligence Data Platform are:

- Centralizing and enhance previously lacking company user knowledge.
- Ensure information is thoroughly tested and error-prone.
- **_Enabling Simple and Fast, Consistent and Reliable, key information consumption and research about our users_**
- Drastically reduce the time spent gathering useful user information from hours to just 3 seconds.
- Supercharge self-serving data analysis and decision-making processes.
- Achieve wide adoption, even among managers with basic SQL skills.
- Provide significant value for the company and stakeholders.

In this repository, you will find a full presentation that narrates the why and the how behind Worker Intelligence. It explains the motivation, goals, and benefits of the data platform, giving you a deeper understanding of the project.

## SQL Code Extract
Additionally, the repository includes an extract of the SQL code used in the development of the Worker Intelligence Data Platform. This code demonstrates the implementation details and the structure of the data platform. You can explore the SQL code to gain insights into the data transformations, queries, and optimizations performed.
