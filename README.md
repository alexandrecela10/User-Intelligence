# User-Intelligence
Ideated, created with SQL and DBT, and deployed (version control, CI/CD) User Intelligence dataplatform, centralizing key user informations, also engineering features. What makes a user more likely to be retained?


# User Intelligence Data Platform

## Overview
The Worker Intelligence Data Platform is a comprehensive solution that aims to enhance company user knowledge by centralizing and creating useful user features. This project involves ideation, building using SQL and DBT, and deploying using CI/CD to create a powerful productionalised data platform. I idetated, built it and deployed it during my time at Indeed. I learnt on the go Data Engineering skills, as I come from a Data Science Background. I felt I needed to quickly access and leverage key user information, and the infrastructure was not there, so I built it.

The key objectives of the Worker Intelligence Data Platform are:

- Centralizing and enhance previously lacking company user knowledge.
- Ensure information is thoroughly tested and error-prone.
- **_Enabling Simple and Fast, Consistent and Reliable, key information consumption and research about our users_**
- Drastically reduce the time spent gathering useful user information from hours to just 3 seconds.
- Supercharge self-serving data analysis and decision-making processes.
- Achieve wide adoption, even among managers with basic SQL skills.
- Provide significant value for the company and stakeholders.

In this repository, you will find a full presentation that narrates the why and the how behind Worker Intelligence. It explains the motivation, goals, and benefits of the data platform, giving you a deeper understanding of the project.
